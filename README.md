# codes
Codes developed for manipulating and extracting certain data from .xlsx documents. In this example, the .xlsx file contains informations about projects, the staff of each project, their roles and the area where they work within each project. Since this informations changes monhly, this code was devoloped to visualize through a new .xlsx file in order to see which is the highest role according the area within the project, how many of them there are and many people are working under each area.
