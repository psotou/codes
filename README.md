# About this code
Codes developed for manipulating and extracting certain data from .xlsx documents. In this example, the .xlsx file contains informations about projects, the staff of each project, their roles and the area where they work within each project. Since this information changes monthly, this code was developed to generate a new .xlsx file in order to see which is the highest role according to the area within the project, how many of them there are and how many people are working under each area for each project.
